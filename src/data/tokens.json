      "description": "Lido is a liquid staking protocol governed by LDO holders through on-chain voting, safeguarded by stETH holders via Dual Governance. The LDO token contract is immutable but has a controller with mint/burn capabilities. The token has unbounded supply due to mint functionality, but minting requires LDO holder majority approval.",
