      "description": "The UNI token is a non-upgradeable ERC20 with algorithmic inflation controls (max 2% per year, hardcoded). Protocol fees across all versions are governed by UNI token holders through on-chain governance votes. UNI is primarily a governance token with no programmatic value accrual at the token level, but governance votes can direct protocol revenue to holders.",
