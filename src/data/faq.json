          "question": "How can I use the Ownership Token Index?",
          "answer": "The index is intended to be used for reviewing and verifying the programmatic economic rights associated with a token using primary evidence. It also considers offchain dependencies that may reinforce or undermine expectations of ownership rights.\n\nThe Ownership Token Index is not an endorsement of any project and not investment advice. It is a framework and tool to help market participants assess token ownership fundamentals using evidence and reach their own conclusions."

          "answer": "We evaluate tokens across four metrics, each containing a checklist of criteria. Each criteria is checked against primary evidence, including:\nOnchain: active deployments, permissions/roles, parameters, execution history.\nOffchain (where relevant): public filings/registrations, published legal terms, and other public documentation.\n\nYou can read the full metrics and methodology here: [link]."

          "answer": "All evidence used by the index is public and linked in the findings. For onchain criteria, we use active deployments and execution history. For offchain criteria, we use public registrations and legal disclaimers (where available).\n\nInitial research and sourcing is done by the Aragon team. Protocol teams, investors, and community members can also submit public primary evidence to support, correct, or challenge specific findings.\n\nYou can learn more about the methodology here: [link]."
