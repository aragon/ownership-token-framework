              "evidences": "Indirect value accrual happens through a burn mechanism using FirePit and FireJar contracts.\n\n**How it works:** [FeeAdapter](https://etherscan.io/address/0x5E74C9f42EEed283bFf3744fBD1889d398d40867d#code) collects protocol fees by calling [collectProtocol](https://github.com/Uniswap/v3-core/blob/d8b1c635c275d2a9450bd6a78f3fa2484fef73eb/contracts/UniswapV3Pool.sol#L848) and sends them to TokenJar. TokenJar has a [release](https://github.com/Uniswap/protocol-fees/blob/8604e4b9aed88bdd6be3a322e19722c40f94be2c/src/TokenJar.sol#L29) function (only callable by FirePit via `onlyReleaser` modifier) that transfers accrued tokens. FirePit's [release function](https://github.com/Uniswap/protocol-fees/blob/8604e4b9aed88bdd6be3a322e19722c40f94be2c/src/releasers/ExchangeReleaser.sol#L45) is permissionless—anyone can call it by burning **4,000 UNI** to receive all accumulated protocol fees in TokenJar.\n\n**The arbitrage:** Rational actors wait until the TokenJar holds more than $24,000 worth of fees (the approximate value of 4,000 UNI) before calling `release`. On the first day post-unification, someone burned 4,000 UNI ($24k) to claim ~$40k in fees, netting $16k profit. Over time, this margin will compress as more people monitor the contract and trigger releases earlier.\n\n**Dynamics:** The 4,000 UNI `threshold` can be changed by governance via the TimeLock contract. If UNI price drops, releases happen more frequently since the burn cost is lower. Governance controls both the threshold and when/how much gets burned.\n\n**Deflationary vs Inflationary:** While burns are deflationary, UNI has a mint function allowing 2% of total supply per year (currently 20M UNI annually for the growth budget, split quarterly—[details here](https://blog.uniswap.org/unification)). For net deflation, burns must exceed 20M UNI/year, which depends on Uniswap transaction volume. Higher volume → more fees → TokenJar fills faster → more frequent burns (at the current 4,000 UNI threshold). If Uniswap maintains dominance and ships good products, the 20M UNI annual spend can be justified by increased trading volume driving more burns."
