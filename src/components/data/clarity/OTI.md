# OTI Control Test Harmonization - Option 2

This document outlines the Ownership Token Index (OTI) framework aligned with the CLARITY Act requirements.

---

## Metric 1: Verifiability

Assesses whether system claims, code, and legal relationships can be independently verified without reliance on insider assertions.

### Criteria

#### Token Contract Source Verification
Determines whether the token contract's source code is publicly available and verifiably matches the deployed bytecode.

#### Protocol Component Source Verification
Determines whether core protocol contracts are publicly accessible and verifiable against their onchain deployments.

---

## Metric 2: Protocol control plane

Assesses whether the protocol operates autonomously under tokenholder-controlled, rule-based governance, without dependence on discretionary actors.

### Criteria

#### On-chain Governance Workflow
Evaluates whether an onchain process exists that grants tokenholders ultimate authority over protocol decisions.

#### Role Accountability
Determines whether all privileged or value-impacting roles are governed, revocable, and accountable to tokenholders.

#### Token Upgrade Authority
Assesses whether token behavior can be modified and, if so, whether such changes are controlled by tokenholder governance.

#### Protocol Upgrade Authority
Determines whether core protocol logic can be upgraded and whether such upgrades are controlled by tokenholders.

### Off-chain considerations

#### Licensing Terms
Assesses whether protocol software, IP, and licensing rights are transparently owned or controlled by tokenholder-governed entities.

---

## Metric 3: Token distribution

Evaluates whether voting power and control are meaningfully distributed rather than concentrated.

### Criteria

#### Ownership Concentration
Measures whether a single actor or coordinated group controls a majority of the voting supply.

---

## Metric 4: Credible neutrality

Evaluates whether token usage and protocol participation are free from discretionary censorship or privileged intervention.

### Criteria

#### Token censorship
Examines whether any roles exist that can freeze, blacklist, seize, or otherwise censor token balances or transfers.

#### Privileged Access Gating
Assesses whether economically meaningful actions or parameters are gated by tokenholder governance rather than discretionary actors.

---

## Metric 5: Value Accrual & Economic Independence

Evaluates whether tokenholder economic claims are programmatic, enforceable, and governance-controlled.

### Criteria

#### Accrual Active
Assesses whether value flows to tokenholders are currently active rather than merely theoretical or proposed.

#### Treasury Ownership
Determines whether protocol treasury assets are programmatically controlled by tokenholder governance.

#### Accrual Mechanism Control
Evaluates whether tokenholders can modify parameters governing value capture, such as fees or revenue routing.

#### Supply Control
Evaluates whether token supply changes are programmatic or subject exclusively to tokenholder-approved governance processes.

### Off-chain considerations

#### Brand
Assesses ownership and control of trademarks and brand assets relevant to the protocol.

#### IP/distribution control
Does any offchain entity control IP or key distribution channels in ways that can redirect economic activity away from tokenholder-aligned routing?

#### Interface value capture
Can a dominant interface collect fees or steer routing in ways that bypass tokenholder-controlled paths?
